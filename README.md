# Amazon Lightsail instance public network IP inspection 

* 🚀 Initialize an Amazon Lightsail instance. 
* 😎 Procure a static IP and link it with the corresponding instance. 
* 🎯 Register a distinct domain name and delegate subdomains to direct traffic towards your Lightsail assets. 
* 🎉 You are now able to access your assets via the registered domain name.

🔍 This application consistently conducts active surveillance on the specified port of the instance. 🚫If access is obstructed, it will renew the static IP of the instance ⚡ and update the domain name record 🔄.
